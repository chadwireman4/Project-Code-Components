<h2>Application: Micro Manage &mu; </h2>
  Our applications is a web based Calender that will hold user events and appointments. <br>
  &mu; will notify users to upcoming appointments and color code events to urgency and importance. <br>
  We will have a task prediction feature, that given a specific task and how much time it will require to complete, &mu; will 
  split it into even portions before the due date and place in open spots in the users calender.
