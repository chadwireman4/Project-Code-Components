All the code for our project

Download the repo

To run:

1) npm install -g nodemon
2) CD into frontend and do npm install
3) CD into backend and do npm install
4) download and set up the micro-manage-db
5) make sure to add the new user so the pg-promise works (in the slack)
6) do npm start on both frontend and backend
7) close out of localhost:3000 and just have 3001 up
