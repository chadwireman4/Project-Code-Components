<h1>Project Summary</h1>

<h2>Overview of MicroManage &mu;</h2>
  <h3>What Does MicroManage do?</h3>
    MicroManage&mu; is a scheduling service which combines an
      intuitive and minimilast user interface to a database which allows
      users to plan out their days, weeks, months, and years. <br>

  <h3>Software Used: </h3>  
  <ul>
    <li> Node.js with Express framework</li>
    <li> React JS</li>
    <li> Postgres DB </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> Dark mode </li>
    <li> Edit events </li>
    <li> Email reminders </li>
    <li> Weather Updates </li>
  </ul>
  
<h1>How to run</h1>
Open a terminal and enter Postgres as root user.<br>
Enter the Postgres Tests directory and Copy-Paste the createUser.sql<br>
into the postgres prompt.<br>
Then copy-paste the templatePostgres.sql in the same prompt.<br>
This creates a user and the database required to run our application. <br>
<br>
<br>
Open two terminals. <br>
npm install -g nodemon (global) or npm install nodemon --save (local)<br>
cd into the backend and frontend directories <br>
Then run in both directories: <br>

npm install <br>

npm start <br> <br>
<h1>Repo Organization/Structure</h1> each branch is dif feature, test-app is staging branch, master is final app
Our final branch is split into two folders, "frontend" and "backend". <br>
The frontend folder contains html and css files. <br>
The backend folder contains the template for the SQL database as well as the API js files. <br><br>

We have multiple branches, each with a different feature:<br> 
testing-app branch is the staging branch, where we test our new code and make sure it implements well.<br>
master branch is all of our tested code that works.<br>
